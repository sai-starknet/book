# Core Cairo Framework

The Sai core Cairo framework is designed for maximum flexibility while remaining highly customizable for specific developer needs. The framework provides modular tools and macros that are loosely coupled, enabling developers to build applications without requiring deep understanding of the entire system architecture.

The framework uses APIs that follow familiar database patterns, making it accessible to developers with traditional backend experience. It includes useful boilerplate code for rapid project setup, including a Dojo-compatible system that enables migration for existing Dojo developers with minimal code changes.
